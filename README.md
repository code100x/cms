## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Docker installed (optional, required for Docker setup).
- Access to a PostgreSQL database (can be local or hosted).

## Setup

### Using Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cms
   ```
3. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Without Docker

1. clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cms
   ```
3. (optional) Start a PostgreSQL database using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
       --name cms-db \
       -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
       -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
       -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase \
       -p 5432:5432 \
       postgres
   ```
   based on this command the connection url will be
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and configure the `DATABASE_URL` with your postgreSQL connection string.
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate:dev
   ```
7. Seed the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```
8. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
